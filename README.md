VOOCH Project


Visualize Out Of Home Creative (VOOHC)

Visualize Out Of Home Creative (VOOHC) is a mobile/web application designed to assist clients in visualizing their
approved out-of-home (OOH) artworks in real-world settings.
The primary purpose of VOOHC is to provide a platform where clients can upload their OOH artwork and preview 
how it will appear in various locations.
The application also offers the ability to test the artwork(s) with the target market and receive instant feedback
before proceeding with the printing process.

Here's an overview of how VOOHC works:

Upload Artworks: Clients can easily upload their approved OOH artworks to the VOOHC platform.
The supported file formats may include common image formats such as JPEG, PNG, or even design files like 
Adobe Photoshop (PSD) or Illustrator (AI).


Select Locations: Once the artwork is uploaded, clients can choose from a database of predefined OOH locations or 
provide specific GPS coordinates for custom locations. These locations represent real-world settings where the OOH 
ads will be displayed, such as billboards, bus shelters, or digital signage.


Visualize Artworks: VOOHC uses advanced image manipulation techniques to superimpose the uploaded artwork onto the
selected OOH locations. The client can then preview how the artwork will appear in different contexts, helping them
make informed decisions about design, placement, and overall impact.


Target Market Testing: In addition to visualizing the artwork in different settings, VOOHC provides a feature for 
testing the artworks with the target market. The client can define specific demographics or audience characteristics 
to simulate the real-world impact of the artwork. The application generates a simulated response or feedback based on
the selected target market, helping the client gauge the effectiveness of their OOH campaign.


Instant Feedback: VOOHC offers immediate feedback on the artwork, taking into account the target market's response.
Clients can receive data and analytics about the simulated impact, including impressions, engagement rates, or even 
sentiment analysis. This feedback can guide further adjustments or optimizations to maximize the effectiveness of the OOH campaign.

Printing and Implementation: Once the client is satisfied with the visualized artwork and feedback, they can proceed
with the printing and implementation of the OOH campaign. VOOHC can assist in providing print-ready files or connect 
clients with printing partners for a seamless transition from the digital preview to real-world advertising.

By utilizing VOOHC, clients can save time and resources by visualizing their OOH artworks before printing, testing them
with their target market, and making data-driven decisions for their advertising campaigns. The application empowers clients 
to optimize their OOH creatives for maximum impact and enhances the overall effectiveness of their marketing efforts.

Project Management: Tools like Jira, Asana, or Trello can be used to manage tasks, track progress, and facilitate team collaboration.
Communication: Platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams help in seamless communication, file sharing, and real-time collaboration among team members.
For the two technology choices, let's consider the front-end framework and the cloud platform:
Front-end Framework: React was chosen as the front-end framework for VOOHC due to its popularity, large community support, and rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. An alternative choice could have been Angular. Angular is a comprehensive JavaScript framework that provides a complete solution for building complex web applications. However, Angular has a steeper learning curve compared to React, and its setup and development processes can be more involved. React, on the other hand, offers a more lightweight and flexible approach, making it easier to learn and faster to develop with, especially for smaller-scale projects like VOOHC.
Cloud Platform: Both AWS and Microsoft Azure are widely used cloud platforms with similar capabilities. The decision between the two depends on factors such as familiarity, specific requirements, pricing, and available integrations. If the team already has experience with one platform or if the project requires specific services offered by a particular platform, that would be a determining factor. For example, if the team has prior experience with AWS and there are specific AWS services required for VOOHC (such as S3 for storage or EC2 for hosting), then AWS would be the preferred choice. However, if there are specific requirements that align better with Azure's offerings or if the team has more experience with Azure, then Azure would be a suitable alternative.
Back-end Framework: Node.js with Express.js was chosen as the back-end framework for VOOHC due to its efficient handling of asynchronous operations, scalability, and large ecosystem of libraries and modules. An alternative choice could have been Django, a high-level Python web framework. Django offers a robust set of features, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database operations and an admin interface for managing data. However, compared to Node.js and Express.js, Django might have a steeper learning curve for developers who are more familiar with JavaScript. Additionally, since VOOHC involves real-time interactions and scalability, the event-driven and non-blocking nature of Node.js makes it a better fit for handling concurrent requests and ensuring smooth performance. Thus, Node.js with Express.js was chosen as the preferred back-end technology for VOOHC.
We have decided to use Node.js with Express.js as our back-end technology, driven by factors such as the need for a scalable and efficient solution, the development team's familiarity and expertise with JavaScript, and the ability to leverage the extensive Node.js ecosystem for additional libraries and tools. 
This combination will allow for seamless integration with the front-end React framework, enabling a unified development experience and efficient communication between the client and server components of VOOHC.
The decision to use a particular technology is based on several factors, including the project requirements, team expertise, scalability needs, available resources, and community support.
